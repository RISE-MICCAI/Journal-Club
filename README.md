# JournalClub
The RISE Journal Club aims to  create a friendly environment to discuss the latest state-of-the-art papers in the areas of medical image analysis, AI and computer vision. The moderators will briefly introduce the paper and then moderate a discussion where everyone is welcome to provide their thoughts and ask any questions on the paper.
