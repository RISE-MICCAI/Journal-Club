#  Why RISE?
- Researchers of under-represented origins (Africa, Latin America,
  South/South-East Asian, and Middle-East) who work in the field of Medical
  Image Computing and Computer-Aided Interventions (MICCAI) are barely
  represented in the community (~around 2% participation to MICCAI 2020).
- Strengthen the presence of minority researchers from Low-to-Middle Income
  Countries (LMIC) in MICCAI.
- Build collaborative bridges across countries and co-develop international
  cutting-edge research projects in medicine with a wider global outreach and
  impact.


# Mission Statement
 - Propel inclusiveness and geographic diversity within MICCAI,
 - Strengthen the presence of minority researchers in Low-to-Middle Income
   Countries (LMICs) at MICCAI,
 - Empower MICCAI researchers in LMICs,
 - Pave the way for future research stars to rise in LMICs and
   under-represented communities, and
 - Build a strong research network within LMICs as well as across continents
   and different parties to help reduce global disparities in health and
   imaging.
